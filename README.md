# Managing Daily Product Inventory
Picture yourself in the role of a developer tasked with crafting a simplified inventory tracking solution for a small business. Your objective is to construct a Java program that receives input in the form of product codes scanned at the end of each day and provides an output revealing the count of each product in the inventory.

# User Instructions:
# 1 Input Collection:
        Input the product codes scanned at the conclusion of each day. These codes should be separated by spaces, mirroring the day's product transactions.

# 2 Observing the Magic:
        Witness the program's magic as it efficiently calculates and unveils the count of each product present in the inventory.

# Expected Output:
The program will showcase the counts of each unique product stored in the inventory, providing a comprehensive overview of the daily transactions.

# Examples:
# Inputs:  5
       		 A
      		 B
      		 C
      		 A
      		 D
# Output:  Product counts in the inventory: 
      		 A: 2
      		 B: 1
      		 C: 1
      		 D: 1

          
# Inputs:  8
      		 x
      		 y
      		 A
      		 z
      		 a
      		 b
      		 x
      		 c
# Output:  Product counts in the inventory: 
      		 A: 2
      		 B: 1
      		 C: 1
      		 X: 2
      		 Y: 1
